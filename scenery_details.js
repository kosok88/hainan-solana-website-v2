        title: "天下第一湾",
        titleEn: "The Best Bay in China",
        intro: `"东方夏威夷"可不是白叫的！亚龙湾的沙滩白得像面粉，细得像丝绸，踩上去软软的，比你家的床还舒服！这里的海水清澈到什么程度？站在岸边就能看到小鱼在水里游来游去，仿佛在说："快来玩呀！"

亚龙湾全长7.5公里，是个标准的"马蹄形"海湾。这个形状有什么好处？风浪小啊！就算外面台风来了，这里也风平浪静。难怪五星级酒店都抢着在这里开业，希尔顿、万豪、丽思卡尔顿...数都数不过来！

这里的海水有"三色"：近处是浅蓝，中间是碧绿，远处是深蓝。当地人开玩笑说："上帝打翻了调色盘，全洒在亚龙湾了！"来这里度假的游客评价："如果天堂有海滩，那一定就是这样的！"

小贴士：早上6点来看日出，傍晚5点来看日落，中午...中午你就躺在沙滩椅上喝椰子吧！海底世界也超美，带上潜水镜，珊瑚和热带鱼随便看！`,
        introEn: `The nickname "Oriental Hawaii" isn't for nothing! Yalong Bay's sand is as white as flour and as fine as silk. Walking on it feels softer than your bed! The water is so clear you can see fish swimming from the shore, as if saying: "Come play!"

Yalong Bay stretches 7.5 kilometers in a perfect "horseshoe" shape. What's the benefit? Minimal waves! Even when typhoons rage outside, it remains calm here. No wonder five-star hotels compete to open here—Hilton, Marriott, Ritz-Carlton... too many to count!

The sea has "three colors": light blue near shore, turquoise in the middle, deep blue far out. Locals joke: "God knocked over his paint palette and spilled it all in Yalong Bay!" Tourists comment: "If heaven has a beach, it must look like this!"

Pro tip: Come at 6 AM for sunrise, 5 PM for sunset, and at noon... just lie on a beach chair drinking coconut water! The underwater world is stunning too—bring your snorkel mask and enjoy corals and tropical fish!`

        titleEn: "China's Maldives",
        intro: `想去马尔代夫太贵？来蜈支洲岛！这座小岛被誉为"中国第一潜水基地"，海水能见度高达27米！什么概念？就是你站在10楼往下看那么清楚！海底的珊瑚礁像一座座水下花园，五颜六色的热带鱼在里面捉迷藏。

岛上有个传说：情侣来这里必须走一遍"情人桥"，走完就能永远在一起。虽然是传说，但来的情侣都走了——万一是真的呢？岛上还有个"妈祖庙"，渔民出海前都来拜拜，求个平安顺利。

蜈支洲岛的海上项目简直是"玩疯了套餐"：潜水、帆船、摩托艇、拖伞、香蕉船...玩到你腿软！最刺激的是"飞鱼"，就是被快艇拖着在海面上飞，速度快到你只能"啊啊啊"地叫！

岛不大，步行2小时能绕一圈。但建议你别走太快，因为每走几步就想拍照——这景色不拍下来，回家怎么发朋友圈装X？记住：防晒霜要涂够，不然晒成"海南黑"回去，同事都认不出你！`,
        introEn: `Maldives too expensive? Come to Wuzhizhou Island! This little island is dubbed "China's #1 Diving Base" with water visibility up to 27 meters! That's like seeing clearly from a 10-story building! Underwater coral reefs resemble gardens with colorful tropical fish playing hide-and-seek.

There's a legend: couples must cross the "Lover's Bridge" to stay together forever. Though it's a legend, every couple walks it—what if it's true? The island also has a "Mazu Temple" where fishermen pray for safe voyages.

Wuzhizhou's water activities are a "go-crazy package": diving, sailing, jet skiing, parasailing, banana boats... until your legs give out! Most thrilling is "Flying Fish"—being towed by a speedboat across the water so fast you can only scream "AAAHH!"

The island is small—a 2-hour walk around. But don't rush; every few steps, you'll want photos—how else will you show off on social media? Remember: apply enough sunscreen, or you'll return as "Hainan Black" and coworkers won't recognize you!`

        titleEn: "Seeking Soulmates at World's End",
        intro: `"天涯海角"不是成语，是真的有这么个地方！海滩上有两块巨石，一块刻着"天涯"，一块刻着"海角"，意思是"世界的尽头"。古人被流放到海南，看到这两块石头就绝望了："妈呀，真到天边了！"现在可不一样，情侣们专程来这里打卡："我陪你到天涯海角！"

这里最有名的是"日月石"和"南天一柱"。南天一柱特别牛，它印在人民币上——对，就是2元纸币背面那块石头！很多游客来这里专门拿着2元钱和石头合影："我和人民币同框了！"

传说中，这里是仙女下凡的地方。两个仙女爱上了凡间的渔民，被王母娘娘发现后变成了两块石头。现在的情侣们都说："我们比仙女还幸福，因为我们能在一起！"景区还有椰林、大海、沙滩，完美的婚纱照取景地！

来这里记得准备点零钱，因为到处都是卖椰子、海螺、贝壳的小贩。他们会说："老板，买个椰子吧，喝了感情甜蜜蜜！"你说不买，他们会说："买一个嘛，2元纸币都花了，还差个椰子钱？"`,
        introEn: `"Tianya Haijiao" isn't just an idiom—it's a real place! Two giant rocks on the beach are inscribed with "Tianya" (Edge of Sky) and "Haijiao" (Corner of Sea), meaning "world's end." Ancient exiles saw these rocks and despaired: "OMG, we've reached the edge!" Now couples flock here: "I'll follow you to world's end!"

Most famous are the "Sun-Moon Rocks" and "Southern Sky Pillar." The pillar is special—it's on Chinese currency! Yes, the back of the 2-yuan note! Tourists specifically pose with 2-yuan bills: "I'm in the same frame as money!"

Legend says fairies descended here. Two fairies fell for mortal fishermen, and the Queen Mother turned them into rocks. Today's couples say: "We're luckier than fairies—we can stay together!" The area also has coconut groves, ocean, and beaches—perfect for wedding photos!

Bring small change for vendors selling coconuts, conches, and shells everywhere. They'll say: "Boss, buy a coconut for sweet love!" If you refuse: "Just one! You already spent that 2-yuan note, what's a coconut more?"`

        title: "三亚市民的后花园",
        titleEn: "Sanya Citizens' Backyard",
        intro: `大东海是三亚最"接地气"的海滩！不像亚龙湾那么高大上，也不像蜈支洲岛那么需要坐船，大东海就在市区，走两步就到了！所以这里是三亚人最爱的"下楼遛弯儿"圣地。早上有老大爷在海边打太极，晚上有年轻人在沙滩上烧烤唱歌。

大东海的海浪比亚龙湾大一点，正好适合冲浪和玩水上项目。很多初学者来这里学冲浪，摔倒了也不怕，海浪会把你"温柔"地推回沙滩。有人总结：亚龙湾是富人的天堂，大东海是普通人的乐园！

这里的海滩长2.9公里，沙子没有亚龙湾那么细，但也够用了。海水清澈度也不错，游个泳、浮个潜，完全没问题。最重要的是，海滩免费！周边的餐饮、住宿都比亚龙湾便宜一大截。一碗海南粉10元，一个椰子5元，良心价啊！

大东海最美的时刻是傍晚。夕阳西下，天空变成橙红色，海面波光粼粼。这时候坐在沙滩上，吹着海风，喝着啤酒，吃着烧烤，跟朋友聊聊天——人生啊，不就是图这个舒坦嘛！`,
        introEn: `Dadonghai is Sanya's most "down-to-earth" beach! Unlike upscale Yalong Bay or boat-requiring Wuzhizhou Island, Dadonghai is downtown—walk and you're there! It's Sanya locals' favorite "neighborhood stroll" spot. Mornings have elderly practicing tai chi by the sea; evenings have young people barbecuing and singing on the beach.

Dadonghai's waves are slightly bigger than Yalong Bay's—perfect for surfing and water sports. Many beginners learn here; falling doesn't hurt as waves "gently" push you back to shore. Someone summarized: Yalong Bay is paradise for the rich, Dadonghai is heaven for common folks!

The beach stretches 2.9 kilometers. Sand isn't as fine as Yalong Bay's but works fine. Water clarity is good for swimming and snorkeling. Most importantly: the beach is FREE! Nearby food and lodging are much cheaper than Yalong Bay. A bowl of Hainan noodles costs 10 yuan, a coconut 5 yuan—such honest prices!

Dadonghai's most beautiful moment is evening. As sunset falls, the sky turns orange-red, waves sparkle. Sitting on the beach, sea breeze blowing, beer in hand, barbecue ready, chatting with friends—life is about this comfort!`

        nameEn: "Yanoda Rainforest",
        title: "热带雨林王国",
        titleEn: "Tropical Rainforest Kingdom",
        intro: `走进呀诺达，就像进了"植物版迪士尼"！这里有超过2000种热带植物，很多你连名字都没听过。导游会告诉你："这是见血封喉树，碰一下就...开玩笑的，我们是观光不是求生！"但这树确实有毒，树汁碰到伤口会很危险，所以只能远观。

"呀诺达"是海南话，意思是"你好、欢迎"。景区里的工作人员见面都喊"呀诺达"，第一次听还以为是什么咒语。雨林里有个"梦幻谷"，瀑布、溪流、巨石、藤蔓，简直是电影《阿凡达》的取景地！走在栈道上，耳边是流水声，头顶是参天大树，脚下是青苔石头，感觉自己是探险家！

最刺激的是"踏瀑戏水"项目！穿上草鞋，沿着溪流往上爬，路过大大小小十几个瀑布。有的瀑布直接从头顶冲下来，爽到飞起！提醒：一定要带换洗衣服，不然湿身回酒店会被保安拦下问："您刚去游泳了？"

雨林里氧气含量超高，被称为"天然氧吧"。有人说在这里深呼吸10分钟，等于在城市里吸一周的氧。所以很多人来这里"洗肺"——吸完氧神清气爽，回家工作又有动力了！`,
        introEn: `Entering Yanoda is like entering a "botanical Disneyland"! Over 2,000 tropical plant species, many you've never heard of. Guides say: "This is the 'Blood Seal Throat' tree—touch it and... just kidding, we're touring, not surviving!" But this tree is indeed toxic; its sap is dangerous on wounds, so observe from afar.

"Yanoda" means "hello, welcome" in Hainanese. Staff greet everyone with "Yanoda"—first-timers think it's a spell! The rainforest has a "Dream Valley" with waterfalls, streams, boulders, and vines—like an Avatar movie set! Walking on plank roads, hearing flowing water, giant trees overhead, mossy rocks underfoot—you feel like an explorer!

Most thrilling is the "Waterfall Trekking" activity! Wearing straw sandals, climb along streams, passing dozens of waterfalls. Some pour directly overhead—so exhilarating! Tip: bring spare clothes, or hotel security will ask: "Did you just go swimming?"

The rainforest has super-high oxygen levels, called a "natural oxygen bar." Someone said 10 minutes deep breathing here equals a week of oxygen in the city. Many come here to "cleanse their lungs"—after oxygen therapy, return home refreshed and motivated for work!`

        nameEn: "Wuzhi Mountain",
        title: "海南屋脊",
        titleEn: "Roof of Hainan",
        intro: `五指山是海南第一高峰，海拔1867米。别看不高，但它在海南就是"珠穆朗玛峰"！山峰真的像五根手指，所以叫五指山。传说孙悟空大闹天宫后被如来佛祖压在五指山下，就是这里！当地人开玩笑："齐天大圣在这住了500年，现在归你们游客了！"

五指山不仅风景美，还是海南的"大水库"。岛上的河流大部分发源于此，所以被称为"海南之肺"。山上云雾缭绕，一年四季如春，平均温度22度，是个避暑胜地。夏天全国都热成狗，这里凉快得像开了空调！

山里住着黎族人民，他们是海南的原住民。到了五指山一定要尝尝黎族特色菜：五脚猪、山兰米酒、竹筒饭。五脚猪不是真的五只脚，而是因为肚子大得拖在地上，看起来像五条腿！山兰米酒甜甜的，喝了不上头，特别适合不会喝酒的人。

爬五指山需要体力，从山脚到山顶要4-5小时。但爬到顶上往下看，云海翻滚，群山环绕，感觉整个海南都踩在脚下！有游客说："这辈子一定要来一次五指山，不然怎么跟别人吹牛说自己爬过海南第一峰？"`,
        introEn: `Wuzhi Mountain is Hainan's highest peak at 1,867 meters. Not tall, but it's Hainan's "Mount Everest"! The peaks really look like five fingers, hence the name. Legend says Sun Wukong was trapped here under Buddha's palm after causing havoc in heaven—right here! Locals joke: "The Monkey King lived here 500 years; now it's yours, tourists!"

Wuzhi Mountain isn't just scenic—it's Hainan's "big reservoir." Most island rivers originate here, earning it the title "Lungs of Hainan." Cloud-shrouded year-round, eternally spring-like with 22°C average temperature—a summer retreat. When all China swelters, here it's air-conditioned cool!

Li ethnic people, Hainan's indigenous residents, live in these mountains. Must-try Li specialties at Wuzhi Mountain: Five-Legged Pig, Shanlan Rice Wine, Bamboo Rice. "Five-Legged Pig" doesn't actually have five legs—its big belly drags on the ground, looking like five limbs! Shanlan Rice Wine is sweet, doesn't cause hangovers—perfect for light drinkers.

Climbing Wuzhi Mountain requires stamina—4-5 hours from base to summit. But reaching the top and looking down—rolling sea of clouds, surrounding mountains—feels like all Hainan is beneath your feet! A tourist said: "You must climb Wuzhi Mountain once in your life, or how can you brag about conquering Hainan's #1 peak?"`

        title: "中国最大的原始热带雨林",
        titleEn: "China's Largest Primary Rainforest",
        intro: `尖峰岭是"终极版热带雨林"！如果说呀诺达是"植物园"，那尖峰岭就是"野生动物园"！这里有600多种树木，还有云豹、黑熊、长臂猿等珍稀动物。不过别担心，这些动物都很害羞，听到人声就跑了，你最多能看到松鼠和猴子。

尖峰岭最神奇的是"天池"——一个藏在山顶的湖泊，海拔900多米。湖水清澈见底，四周是原始森林，空气清新得让人醉。有游客说："站在天池边深呼吸，感觉肺都被洗干净了！"天池水温常年保持在20度左右，夏天来这里游泳，透心凉！

雨林里有很多珍贵的树种，比如"见血封喉"、"绞杀榕"、"空心木棉"。绞杀榕特别有意思，它会缠绕其他大树生长，最后把大树"勒死"，自己独立存活。导游会开玩笑："这树教会我们一个道理——选朋友很重要！"

尖峰岭还有个"中国第一条热带雨林科考玻璃栈道"，全长400米，离地40米高。走在上面往下看，雨林全景尽收眼底。有恐高症的游客走到一半腿软了："我为什么要来这里证明自己是勇士？"但克服恐惧后，那种成就感无法言表！`,
        introEn: `Jianfengling is the "ultimate tropical rainforest"! If Yanoda is a "botanical garden," Jianfengling is a "wildlife park"! Over 600 tree species, plus rare animals like clouded leopards, black bears, and gibbons. Don't worry—these shy creatures flee at human sounds; you'll mostly see squirrels and monkeys.

Most magical is the "Heavenly Pool"—a mountain-top lake at 900+ meters elevation. Crystal-clear water, surrounded by primary forest, air so fresh it's intoxicating. A tourist said: "Deep breathing at Heavenly Pool feels like my lungs got washed!" Water temperature stays around 20°C year-round—summer swimming here is refreshingly cool!

The rainforest has precious tree species like "Blood Seal Throat," "Strangler Fig," and "Hollow Kapok." Strangler Fig is fascinating—it wraps around other trees, eventually "strangling" them and surviving independently. Guides joke: "This tree teaches us—choosing friends is important!"

Jianfengling also has "China's First Tropical Rainforest Glass Skywalk," 400 meters long, 40 meters high. Walking on it, looking down, the rainforest panorama unfolds. Acrophobic tourists halfway through go weak-kneed: "Why did I come here to prove I'm brave?" But overcoming fear brings indescribable achievement!`

        intro: `分界洲岛是个"神奇的岛"！它正好在海南气候的分界线上：北边多云，南边晴朗。所以经常出现一边下雨一边出太阳的奇观！当地人说："分界洲岛就像一道门，穿过去就是另一个世界！"

岛不大，但玩的项目超多！海底观光潜水艇带你下到20米深的海底，透过玻璃窗看珊瑚礁和鱼群，就像在《海底总动员》里一样！不会游泳也能体验海底世界，简直太赞了！岛上还有"海豚湾"，可以和海豚亲密接触，摸摸它、喂喂鱼，海豚还会"亲"你一下！

分界洲岛的海底有个"海洋牧场"，养了很多海洋生物。潜水的时候能看到魔鬼鱼、海龟、海星，甚至还有小鲨鱼（温顺的那种）！有个潜水教练说："分界洲岛的海底，比水族馆还精彩，因为这些都是野生的！"

岛上还有个"月光古堡"，是拍婚纱照的圣地。白色的城堡配上蓝色的大海，简直是童话世界！很多情侣专程来这里拍照，然后发朋友圈："我们在海上城堡结婚了！"评论区羡慕死一片："什么时候带我去？"`,
        introEn: `Fenjiezhou Island is a "magical island"! It sits right on Hainan's climate divide: north cloudy, south sunny. Often you see rain on one side, sun on the other—a spectacle! Locals say: "Fenjiezhou Island is like a door; cross it and enter another world!"

The island is small but packed with activities! An underwater observatory submarine takes you 20 meters deep; through glass windows, see coral reefs and fish schools—like in Finding Nemo! Non-swimmers can experience the underwater world too—amazing! The island also has "Dolphin Bay" for close dolphin encounters—touch them, feed them, they might even "kiss" you!

Fenjiezhou's seabed has an "ocean ranch" raising many marine creatures. While diving, see manta rays, sea turtles, starfish, even small sharks (the gentle kind)! A diving instructor said: "Fenjiezhou's seabed is more spectacular than aquariums because these are wild!"

The island also has a "Moonlight Castle," a wedding photo hotspot. White castle against blue ocean—a fairy tale world! Many couples come specifically for photos, then post on social media: "We got married in a sea castle!" Comments flood with envy: "When will you take me?"`

        intro: `骑楼老街是海口的"时光隧道"！走进这里，仿佛穿越回上世纪三十年代。街道两旁都是南洋风格的骑楼建筑，一楼是店铺，二楼是居住，骑楼下面可以遮阳避雨。这种设计超实用——海南天气多变，骑楼就是天然的"雨棚"！

这些骑楼都是当年"下南洋"的华侨回来建的。他们在南洋赚了钱，回家乡盖房子，把南洋的建筑风格带回来，就有了现在的骑楼老街。每栋楼都有故事：这家是当年的"大福源"百货，那家是"永安堂"药店，还有"新华书店"的前身！

老街最热闹的是早上和傍晚。早上，老海口人来这里喝老爸茶（海南特色茶饮）、吃海南粉、聊八卦。傍晚，年轻人来逛文创店、咖啡馆、买特产。有人说："骑楼老街白天是老年人的，晚上是年轻人的，完美和谐！"

一定要尝尝老街的小吃：海南清补凉、椰子糕、猪脚饭、糟粕醋。清补凉特别好吃，椰奶冰加上各种配料，夏天吃一碗，透心凉！糟粕醋是海南特色，酸酸的，开胃又消暑。吃完你会说："海口，我还会再来的！"`,
        introEn: `Qilou Street is Haikou's "time tunnel"! Entering here feels like traveling back to the 1930s. Streets lined with Nanyang-style arcade buildings—shops on ground floors, residences above, arcades below for shade and rain shelter. This design is super practical—Hainan's changeable weather makes arcades natural "awnings"!

These arcades were built by overseas Chinese returning from Nanyang. They made money abroad, came home to build houses, bringing Nanyang architectural style, creating today's Qilou Street. Every building has stories: this was the old "Da Fu Yuan" department store, that was "Yong An Tang" pharmacy, and the predecessor to "Xinhua Bookstore"!

The street bustles mornings and evenings. Mornings, old Haikou residents drink Laoba Tea (Hainan specialty tea), eat Hainan noodles, gossip. Evenings, young people browse creative shops, cafes, buy souvenirs. Someone said: "Qilou Street belongs to elderly by day, youth by night—perfect harmony!"

Must-try street snacks: Hainan Qingbuliang, coconut cake, pork knuckle rice, vinegar dregs. Qingbuliang is delicious—coconut milk ice with various toppings, a bowl in summer—so refreshing! Vinegar dregs are a Hainan specialty, sour, appetizing, and heat-relieving. After eating, you'll say: "Haikou, I'll return!"`

南山寺是海南最大的佛教寺庙，建在海边，背山面海。清晨来这里，听着海浪声，看着僧人做早课，整个人都平静下来。寺里有一口"金玉观音"，用100多公斤黄金、120多克拉钻石、数千颗珍珠打造，价值1.92亿！看完你会感叹："贫穷限制了我的想象力！"

南山还有"长寿谷"，里面种了很多长寿植物。传说吃了南山的素斋，能增寿十年！当然这只是传说，但南山素斋确实好吃：素鱼、素肉、素鸡...比真的还好吃！有游客吃完说："这才是真正的'假作真时真亦假'！"

来南山一定要走一圈"不二法门"。这个门很大，走过去就是"放下执念，回归本心"。很多人在这里许愿："希望家人健康，工作顺利，早日暴富！"有个和尚笑着说："许愿可以，但还得靠自己努力！"`,
        introEn: `The "Nanshan" in the saying "Fortune like East Sea, longevity like Nanshan" is right here! Most stunning in Nanshan Cultural Zone is the 108-meter "Nanhai Guanyin" statue—the world's tallest ocean Guanyin! Standing at her feet looking up, your neck almost breaks. The three-faced statue represents "compassion, wisdom, peace"—solemn and magnificent!

Nanshan Temple is Hainan's largest Buddhist temple, built seaside, backed by mountains facing ocean. Coming here at dawn, hearing wave sounds, watching monks' morning prayers, you feel completely peaceful. The temple has a "Gold-Jade Guanyin" made with over 100 kg gold, 120+ carats diamonds, thousands of pearls—worth 192 million yuan! After seeing it, you'll sigh: "Poverty limits my imagination!"

Nanshan also has "Longevity Valley" with many longevity plants. Legend says eating Nanshan vegetarian meals adds ten years of life! Just legend, but Nanshan vegetarian food is delicious: vegetarian fish, meat, chicken... better than real! A tourist said after eating: "This is truly 'fake becoming real when real becomes fake'!"

At Nanshan, definitely walk through "Non-Duality Gate." This large gate symbolizes "releasing attachments, returning to original heart." Many make wishes here: "Hope for family health, work success, quick wealth!" A monk smiled: "Wishing is fine, but you must work hard yourself!"`

论坛永久会址超级漂亮！建筑采用"飞檐翘角"的中国风设计，远看像一只展翅的大鸟。会址前面是万泉河入海口，三江交汇，形成一个天然的"品"字形。站在观景台上看，江水、大海、椰林、沙滩，构成一幅绝美的画卷！

博鳌玉带滩更是奇观！这是一条1.5公里长的狭长沙滩，一边是波涛汹涌的大海，一边是平静如镜的河流。走在沙滩上，左手大海右手河，同时体验两种水域，太神奇了！有人说："玉带滩是上帝遗落的腰带！"

博鳌镇还有个"蔡家宅"，是华侨巨贾蔡家的祖宅，已有上百年历史。建筑融合了中西风格，既有中国的屋檐，又有西洋的窗户。现在是个博物馆，展示华侨下南洋的历史。参观完你会感叹："那个年代的人真不容易，漂洋过海去打拼！"`,

It's "Asia's Davos," where every spring, leaders, entrepreneurs, and scholars from various countries gather to discuss Asian and global affairs. Anyone meeting here is a big shot, so Boao is called the "diplomatic town."

The forum's permanent site is gorgeous! Architecture features "flying eaves and upturned corners" in Chinese style, looking like a big bird spreading wings from afar. In front is the Wanquan River estuary where three rivers converge, forming a natural "品" shape. Standing on the observation deck, seeing rivers, ocean, coconut groves, beaches—an exquisite picture!

Boao Jade Belt Beach is a wonder! This 1.5-kilometer-long narrow beach has rough ocean on one side, mirror-calm river on the other. Walking on the beach, ocean left, river right—experiencing two water bodies simultaneously—so magical! Someone said: "Jade Belt Beach is God's lost belt!"

Boao town also has "Cai Family Residence," ancestral home of overseas Chinese tycoon Cai family, over a century old. Architecture blends Chinese and Western styles—Chinese eaves with Western windows. Now a museum displaying overseas Chinese history in Nanyang. After visiting, you'll sigh: "People back then had it tough, crossing oceans to make a living!"`

发射场建在海边有个重要原因：运输方便！大型火箭太重了，陆地运输不现实，只能走海运。火箭从天津港装船，经过长江、东海、南海，最后抵达文昌。整个过程就像一场"火箭邮轮之旅"！

文昌发射场还有个"网红点"——龙楼观景台。每次火箭发射，这里挤满了人，大家举着相机、望远镜、手机，准备记录火箭升空的震撼时刻！发射前倒计时："10、9、8...3、2、1，点火！"火箭喷出橙红色的火焰，伴随着巨大的轰鸣声冲向天空！现场的人都激动得跳起来："成功了！成功了！"

文昌不仅有航天城，还有很多美食：文昌鸡、抱罗粉、椰子饭。文昌鸡是海南四大名菜之一，皮脆肉嫩，配上蘸料简直绝了！有人说："来文昌既能看火箭上天，又能吃鸡，两全其美！"`,
        introEn: `Wenchang Space Launch Center is China's fourth satellite launch center and only coastal site! Here you can not only launch satellites but also see the ocean, feel sea breezes, eat coconuts—truly a "vacation-style launch site"! The launch tower is beside the beach; tourists joke: "These rockets have ocean views!"

Building the site seaside has an important reason: convenient transport! Large rockets are too heavy for land transport—only sea shipping works. Rockets ship from Tianjin Port, traveling through Yangtze River, East China Sea, South China Sea, finally arriving at Wenchang. The whole process is like a "rocket cruise trip"!

Wenchang Launch Site also has an "internet-famous spot"—Longlou Observation Platform. Every rocket launch, it's packed with people holding cameras, telescopes, phones, ready to record the thrilling liftoff! Launch countdown: "10, 9, 8... 3, 2, 1, ignition!" The rocket spews orange-red flames, accompanied by tremendous roar, shooting skyward! Everyone on-site jumps excitedly: "Success! Success!"

Wenchang offers not just the space center but also delicious food: Wenchang Chicken, Baoluo Noodles, Coconut Rice. Wenchang Chicken is one of Hainan's four famous dishes—crispy skin, tender meat, with dipping sauce—amazing! Someone said: "Coming to Wenchang, you can watch rockets soar and eat chicken—best of both worlds!"`
